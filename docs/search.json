    "section": "\n1.2 Tidyverse: A Revolution in R",
    "text": "1.2 Tidyverse: A Revolution in R\nIn recent years, the emergence of tidyverse libraries has brought significant advancements to R, making data manipulation and analysis more straightforward. One notable innovation within the tidyverse is the introduction of pipe operations, marked by |&gt;, which streamline workflows and improve code readability.\nThe pipe operator allows you to chain data manipulation functions, effortlessly passing the output from one function to the next. This creates a more linear and intuitive sequence of operations, reducing the reliance on temporary variables and minimizing nested function calls. The result is code that is more comprehensible and easier to maintain.\nConsider a straightforward example of the pipe operator’s utility in R:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n# Creating a sample data frame\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n  Name = c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"),\n  Age = c(28, 35, 22)\n)\n\n# Utilizing the pipe operator for data manipulation\nresult &lt;- data |&gt;\n  filter(Age &gt;= 25) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Age))\n\nprint(result)\n\n   Name Age\n1   Bob  35\n2 Alice  28\n\n\nIn this instance, we initially filter the rows where Age is greater than or equal to 25 and then arrange the data in descending order of Age. The pipe operator (|&gt;) effortlessly conveys the data frame from one operation to the next, rendering the code more succinct and comprehensible.\nThe pipe operator (|&gt;) elevates code readability by facilitating a natural and intuitive sequence of data manipulation operations. Let’s elucidate this with some examples.\nWithout the Pipe Operator:\nImagine you have a data frame containing a list of products, and you need to perform a series of data manipulations: filtering the products in stock, converting prices to a different currency, and calculating the average price of the remaining products. In the absence of the pipe operator, the code might resemble this:\n\n# Without the pipe operator\nin_stock_products &lt;- filter(products, stock_quantity &gt; 0)\nconverted_prices &lt;- mutate(in_stock_products, price_usd = price * exchange_rate)\naverage_price &lt;- mean(converted_prices$price_usd)\n\nIn this code, you must create intermediate variables (in_stock_products and converted_prices) to store the results at each step, which diminishes code readability.\nWith the Pipe Operator:\nNow, let’s rewrite the same task using the pipe operator:\n\naverage_price &lt;- products |&gt;\n  filter(stock_quantity &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  mutate(price_usd = price * exchange_rate) |&gt;\n  summarise(average_price = mean(price_usd))\n\nWith the pipe operator, the code unfolds as a coherent sequence, and you can execute operations on the data frame step by step, without the need for interim variables. This enhances code readability and facilitates comprehension. Each operation is distinct, and their order aligns with the logical flow of data manipulation.\nThe pipe operator also accommodates more intricate chains of operations, further enhancing code clarity. Here’s an extended example where we filter products, group them by category, calculate the average price for each category, and then sort the results:\n\nresult &lt;- products |&gt;\n  filter(stock_quantity &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  group_by(category) |&gt;\n  mutate(price_usd = price * exchange_rate) |&gt;\n  summarise(average_price = mean(price_usd)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(average_price))\n\nThe tidyverse represents a significant change in data analysis. Beyond simplifying data manipulation, it comprises a collection of packages designed to streamline data handling, analysis, and visualization. With tools like dplyr for efficient data manipulation and ggplot2 for effective data visualization, the tidyverse reshapes data analysis by providing a cohesive toolkit for modern data-driven tasks, benefiting data scientists and analysts."

    "text": "3.6 Data Import in R\nData import is a crucial step in data analysis using R. R provides various functions and packages to import and manipulate data from different sources. Here, we’ll cover how to import pre-available data and work with commonly used file formats like CSV, TXT, and Excel.\n\n3.6.1 Importing Pre-Available Data\nIn R, there are built-in datasets that you can use for practice and analysis. One such dataset is the “mtcars” dataset.\n\n# Load the built-in \"mtcars\" dataset\ndata(mtcars)\n\n# View the first few rows of the dataset\nhead(mtcars)\n\n                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\n\n\nThe “mtcars” dataset is now available for analysis.\n\n3.6.2 Importing Data from CSV\nSuppose you have data in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file. You can use the read_csv() function from the Tidyverse to import it. Here’s an example:\n\n# Import data from a CSV file\nmy_data &lt;- read_csv(\"my_data.csv\")\n\n# Display the first few rows of the imported data\nhead(my_data)\n\nReplace \"my_data.csv\" with the actual path to your CSV file.\n\n3.6.3 Importing Data from Text (TXT) Files\nTo import data from a plain text file, you can use the read_delim() function from Tidyverse. This function is versatile and can handle various delimiters, making it suitable for tab-delimited or space-delimited files. Here’s an example:\n\n# Import data from a text file\nmy_data &lt;- read_delim(\"my_data.txt\", delim = \"\\t\")\n\n# Display the first few rows of the imported data\nhead(my_data)\n\nReplace \"my_data.txt\" with the actual path to your text file and adjust the delim parameter as needed to match your file’s delimiter.\n\n3.6.4 Importing Data from Excel\nTo import data from Excel files, you can use the readxl package. First, install the package and then use the read_excel() function to import data from an Excel file.\nAssuming you have an Excel file named \"dairy_data.xlsx\" with a sheet named \"Cattle_Info\", you can import it as follows:\n\n# Install and load the \"readxl\" package (install only once)\n# install.packages(\"readxl\")\nlibrary(readxl)\n\n# Import data from an Excel file\ncattle_data_excel &lt;- read_excel(\"dairy_data.xlsx\", sheet = \"Cattle_Info\")\n\n# View the first few rows of the imported data\nhead(cattle_data_excel)\n\n\n3.6.5 Beyond Local Files\nBeyond local data storage, R enables you to seamlessly import datasets from the internet. This functionality provides access to a wide range of online data sources.\nTo import a dataset from the internet into R, you can employ the functions previously discussed, depending on the file format accessible via a URL. Let’s illustrate this with a practical example involving a .csv file related to milk production for dairy cows, hosted on GitHub. Here’s how to import this data into R:\n\n# Define the URL of the dataset\ndata_url &lt;- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-01-29/state_milk_production.csv\"\n\n\n# Import data from the internet\nstate_milk_production &lt;- read_csv(data_url, show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n# View the first few rows of the imported data\nhead(state_milk_production)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  region    state          year milk_produced\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Northeast Maine          1970     619000000\n2 Northeast New Hampshire  1970     356000000\n3 Northeast Vermont        1970    1970000000\n4 Northeast Massachusetts  1970     658000000\n5 Northeast Rhode Island   1970      75000000\n6 Northeast Connecticut    1970     661000000"

Understanding these data types is essential for effective data analysis. Let’s expand upon the data types in the context of the provided text.\n\n3.1.1 Character\nCharacter data types are used to represent text or strings. They are enclosed in single or double quotes and are ideal for working with labels, names, or textual data.\nExample:\n\n# Name of a dairy cow\ncow_name &lt;- \"Bessie\"\n\n\n3.1.2 Factor\nFactors are a unique data type in R, often used to represent categorical data. They have predefined levels, making them suitable for variables with distinct categories or levels.\nExample:\n\n# Cow breeds as a factor\ncow_breeds &lt;- factor(c(\"Holstein\", \"Jersey\", \"Guernsey\", \"Simmental\"))\n\n\n3.1.3 Double\nDouble data types represent numeric values, typically in decimal form. They are used for storing continuous, real-valued data, such as measurements and percentages.\nExample:\n\n# Milk production in gallons\nmilk_production_gallons &lt;- 15.5\n\n\n3.1.4 Integer\nInteger data types are used for whole numbers without decimal points. They are ideal for representing counts, quantities, or discrete values.\nExample:\n\n# Number of calves born\nnum_calves &lt;- 5L  # The 'L' indicates it's an integer\n\n\n3.1.5 Logical\nLogical data types, often referred to as booleans, represent binary values: TRUE or FALSE. They are essential for making logical comparisons and decisions in your code.\nExample:\n\n# Is the cow healthy?\nis_healthy &lt;- TRUE\n\n\n3.1.6 Date\nDate data types are used to work with dates and times. They allow you to represent specific points in time, including date and time together, in a structured manner.\nExample:\n\n# Date of last milk collection\nlast_milk_collection &lt;- as.Date(\"2023-10-25\")\n\n\n3.1.7 Lists\nLists are a versatile data type in R, capable of storing various objects of different types. They can contain scalars, vectors, data frames, and more.\nExample:\n\n# Information about a dairy farm as a list\nfarm_info &lt;- list(farm_name = \"Green Meadows\", location = \"Wisconsin\", cows = c(550, 600, 520, 580, 630), is_organic = FALSE)\n\nVarious types of data can be organized using a diverse range of data structures, as previously mentioned scalars, vectors, matrices, and data frames.\n\n3.1.8 Scalars\nScalars are single values in R. They can be integers, decimals, or characters. You might use scalars to represent individual data points.\nExample:\n\n# Number of dairy cows on a farm\nnum_cows &lt;- 100\n\n\n3.1.9 Vectors\nVectors are one-dimensional arrays that can store multiple values of the same data type. They are commonly used in R to work with collections of data. For example, you might use vectors to store information about individual cow weights.\nExample:\n\n# Weight of dairy cows in kilograms\ncow_weights &lt;- c(550, 600, 520, 580, 630)\n\n\n3.1.10 Matrices\nMatrices are two-dimensional arrays that can store data of the same data type. You might use matrices to represent data tables, like the weights of multiple cows over time.\nExample:\n\n# Create a matrix with cow weights for two weeks\ncow_weight_matrix &lt;- matrix(c(550, 600, 520, 580, 630, 560, 610, 530, 590, 640), nrow = 5, byrow = TRUE)\ncolnames(cow_weight_matrix) &lt;- c(\"Week1\", \"Week2\")\nrownames(cow_weight_matrix) &lt;- c(\"Cow1\", \"Cow2\", \"Cow3\", \"Cow4\", \"Cow5\")\n\n\n3.1.11 Data Frames\nData frames are a common data structure in R, designed for tabular data. They can store different types of data (e.g., scalars, vectors) in columns. You might use data frames to organize data like cow ID, age, weight, and milk production.\nExample:\n\n# Create a data frame with information about dairy cows\ndairy_cows &lt;- data.frame(\n  ID = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),\n  Name = c(\"Bessie\", \"MooMoo\", \"Daisy\", \"Buttercup\", \"Elsie\"),\n  Age = c(5, 4, 6, 3, 7),\n  Weight_kg = cow_weights,\n  Milk_Production_liters = c(20, 18, 22, 19, 21)\n)"

The between() function in R is a powerful tool that enables advanced filtering by allowing you to extract rows where a variable falls within a defined range. Let’s explore how to use this function for more complex filtering tasks. For instance, suppose you want to perform advanced filtering to select rows with years falling within the range of 2015 to 2020:\n\n# Advanced filtering: Select data for a specific range of years\nfiltered_data &lt;- state_milk_production |&gt;\n  filter(between(year, 2015, 2020))\n\nprint(filtered_data)\n\n# A tibble: 150 × 4\n   region    state          year milk_produced\n   &lt;chr&gt;

Specifically, we aim to understand the relationship between the consumption of American cheese and mozzarella cheese over the years.\nInstructions:\n\nSelect relevant variables from each dataset. From “milk_products_facts,” select “year” and “cheese_american.” From “clean_cheese,” select “Year” and “Mozzarella.”\nMerge the datasets using a common variable, which is “year.”\nCalculate the ratio of American cheese consumption to mozzarella consumption for each year.\nCreate a line plot using the ggplot2 package to visualize how the ratio of American cheese consumption to mozzarella consumption has changed over the years.\n\nAnswer:\n\n# Perform data manipulation\nmilk_products_facts &lt;- milk_products_facts %&gt;%\n  select(year, cheese_american) \n\nclean_cheese &lt;- clean_cheese %&gt;%\n  select(Year, Mozzarella) \n\n# Merge the datasets on the \"year\" variable\nmerged_data &lt;- left_join(milk_products_facts, clean_cheese, by = c(\"year\" = \"Year\"))\n\n# Calculate the ratio of American cheese consumption to mozzarella consumption\nmerged_data &lt;- merged_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(ratio = cheese_american / Mozzarella)\n\n# Create a line plot\nggplot(merged_data, aes(x = year, y = ratio)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Ratio (American Cheese / Mozzarella)\",\n    title = \"Ratio of American Cheese to Mozzarella Consumption Over the Years\"\n  )"

    "text": "In the previous section, we explored a basic line plot using the ggplot2 package in R. We visualized the ratio of American Cheese to Mozzarella consumption over the years with a simple line and point plot. Here’s the code for the previous plot:\n\nggplot(merged_data, aes(x = year, y = ratio)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Ratio (American Cheese / Mozzarella)\",\n    title = \"Ratio of American Cheese to Mozzarella Consumption Over the Years\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nThe power of data visualization is crucial in the field of data analysis and exploration. It allows us to gain insights from data, identify patterns, and convey complex information in an understandable manner. ggplot2, a popular data visualization package in R, is a versatile and powerful tool for creating a wide range of plots and graphs.\nWhat sets ggplot2 apart is its unique layering system, which allows you to add different components to a plot in a structured and modular way. Layers enable us to build complex and informative visualizations by adding various elements to our plots, such as multiple data series, labels, titles, and more.\nAs an example, we can present the earlier plot in the following manner:\n\nggplot(merged_data, aes(x = year, y = ratio)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", \n              formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), \n              se = TRUE, color = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Ratio (American Cheese / Mozzarella)\",\n    title = \"Ratio of American Cheese to Mozzarella Consumption Over the Years\",\n    subtitle = \"Plot with Regression Lines\",\n    caption = \"Data source: GitHub\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a quick breakdown:\n\n\nData and Aesthetics (ggplot):\n\nWe start with the ggplot function, specifying the dataset merged_data and aesthetic mappings. The x-axis represents the “year,” and the y-axis represents the “ratio.”\n\n\n\nScatterplot (geom_point):\n\nThe geom_point layer is added to create a scatterplot of data points. Each point represents a data entry.\nThe size parameter is set to 2, making the points larger for better visibility.\n\n\n\nLine Plot (geom_line):\n\nThe geom_line layer is used to create a line plot. This line connects the data points in chronological order, providing a visual representation of the trend.\nThe color parameter is set to “blue,” and the linewidth parameter is set to 1 to customize the color and thickness of the line.\n\n\n\nRegression Line (geom_smooth):\n\nWe’ve added a regression line to the plot using the geom_smooth layer.\nThe method is set to lm (linear model), indicating a linear regression model.\nThe formula argument specifies a polynomial regression model (y ~ poly(x, 2)) of degree 2.\nThe se parameter is set to TRUE, which adds confidence intervals around the regression line, giving an indication of the uncertainty.\nThe color parameter is set to “red” to make the regression line visually distinct.\n\n\n\nLabels (labs):\n\nThe labs function is used to add labels and titles to the plot. It provides clarity and context to the visualization.\nThe x-axis label is “Year”, the y-axis label is “Ratio (American Cheese / Mozzarella)”, the main title is “Ratio of American Cheese to Mozzarella Consumption Over the Years”, the subtitle specifies that this is a plot with regression lines, and the caption attributes the data source to “GitHub”.\n\n\n\nTheme (theme_minimal):\n\nFinally, the theme_minimal() function is applied to give the plot a clean and uncluttered appearance. This minimal theme provides a simple background, allowing the data and plot elements to take center stage."

    "text": "5.1 ggplot2 grammar\nggplot2, is built on the foundation of the “Grammar of Graphics.” This framework allows you to create intricate and customized plots by layering (Figure 5.1) different geometric shapes and elements. Understanding the concept of geometry and layering is essential for informative visualizations.\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Source: Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science (2022), Chapter 5 in Workshop 3: Introduction to Data Visualization. source.\n\nBelow, we present a breakdown of different elements and common parameters for each within the Grammar of Graphics framework:\n\n5.1.1 Basic elements\nData: This refers to your dataset, organized in a tidy format, and serves as the foundation for your plot. You can utilize dplyr techniques to prepare the data for optimal plotting, usually requiring one row for each observation you intend to visualize.\nAesthetics (aes): Aesthetics are parameters that make the data visually meaningful. Here are some common aesthetics:\n\n\nx, y: Represent variables along the x and y axes, respectively.\n\ncolour: Dictates the color of the graphic elements based on data.\n\nfill: Specifies the interior color of the graphical element.\n\ngroup: Defines the group to which a graphical element belongs.\n\nshape: Determines the figure used for plotting a point.\n\nlinetype: Specifies the type of line to be used (e.g., solid, dashed).\n\nsize: Controls the size of elements to represent an additional dimension.\n\nalpha: Governs the transparency level of the graphical element.\n\nGeometric Objects (geoms): Geoms determine the type of plot to create. Here are some common geoms:\n\n\ngeom_point(): Used for scatterplots.\n\ngeom_line(): Connects points in increasing order of x values.\n\ngeom_path(): Connects points in the sequence of appearance.\n\ngeom_boxplot(): Generates box and whisker plots for categorical variables.\n\ngeom_bar(): Creates bar charts, typically used for categorical x-axes.\n\ngeom_histogram(): Produces histograms, commonly for continuous x-axes.\n\ngeom_violin(): Represents the kernel of data dispersion in a distribution.\n\ngeom_smooth(): Generates a function line based on data.\n\nFacets: Faceting helps create small multiples, allowing you to visualize subsets of your data. You can use facet_wrap() or facet_grid() for this purpose.\nStatistics: Statistics are similar to geoms, but they are computed values that summarize your data. They can show means, counts, and other statistical summaries.\nCoordinates: Coordinates determine how data is mapped onto the plot. Here are some coordinate options:\n\n\ncoord_cartesian: Sets limits for the plot.\n\ncoord_polar: Used for circular plots.\n\ncoord_map: Applied for various map projections.\n\nThemes: Themes define the overall visual defaults for your plot. You can use themes to specify fonts, colors, shapes, and outlines to achieve a consistent visual style.\nNext, we will demonstrate the layering grammar of ggplot2. On this example we will learn how to create a scatterplot with ggplot2 and add layers, geometries, and configurations step by step using simulated dairy cattle production data.\nStep 1: Inserting data and Aesthetics\n\n# Simulated dairy cattle production data\nset.seed(123)\ncattle_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  Year = 2000:2020,\n  Milk_Production = runif(21, min = 8000, max = 12000)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Cheese_Production = (Milk_Production * 0.3) + rnorm(21, 0, 100))\n\n# Create a ggplot object with data and aesthetics\nscatter_plot &lt;- ggplot(cattle_data, aes(x = Milk_Production, y = Cheese_Production))\nscatter_plot\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Adding the Scatterplot (points) Geometry\n\n# Add the scatterplot geometry using geom_point\nscatter_plot &lt;- scatter_plot + geom_point()\nscatter_plot\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Adding Labels and Title\n\n# Add labels and a title\nscatter_plot &lt;- scatter_plot +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Milk Production (Millions of Pounds)\",\n    y = \"Cheese Production (Millions of Pounds)\",\n    title = \"Scatterplot of Milk vs. Cheese Production\"\n  )\nscatter_plot\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Applying a Minimal Theme\n\n# Apply a minimal theme\nscatter_plot &lt;- scatter_plot + theme_minimal()\n\n# Display the scatter plot\nprint(scatter_plot)"

    "text": "5.2 Exploring Geometries\nIn this instance, we will present different geometric shapes and their application in ggplot2 visualizations.\nExample (Simple Line Plot)\nIn ggplot2, a line plot is often utilized in conjunction with a scatterplot, as they are frequently applied to the same dataset and serve the same visualization purpose. It is not uncommon for both types of plots to be used together.\n\n# Create a ggplot object for a scatterplot and line plot\nline_plot &lt;- ggplot(cattle_data, aes(x = Milk_Production, y = Cheese_Production)) +\n  geom_point() +  # Scatterplot (points)\n  geom_line() +   # Line plot\n  labs(\n    x = \"Milk Production (Millions of Pounds)\",\n    y = \"Cheese Production (Millions of Pounds)\",\n    title = \"Scatterplot of Milk vs. Cheese Production\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\nline_plot  # Display the combined plot\n\n\n\n\nThis type of plot is commonly employed to visualize and describe time series data, particularly in the context of climate and environmental data over time.\n\n# Create a sample time series dataset\nset.seed(123)\ndate_range &lt;- seq(as.Date(\"2023-01-01\"), as.Date(\"2023-12-01\"), by=\"1 month\")\ntemperature_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  Date = date_range,\n  Temperature = runif(length(date_range), min = 0, max = 30)\n)\n\n# Create a time series plot\nggplot(temperature_data, aes(x = Date, y = Temperature)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_line() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Temperature (°C)\",\n    title = \"Monthly Temperature Time Series\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nExample (Histogram)\nHistograms are a commonly employed data visualization tool to illustrate the frequency distribution of a specific variable. To illustrate this, we will use the “state_milk_production” dataset, filtering it for a particular year (as it is not meaningful to examine the distribution of a variable measured over multiple years).\n\n# Filter the dataset for a specific year and select the 'milk_produced' column\nyear_to_analyze &lt;- 1980\nfiltered_data &lt;- state_milk_production %&gt;%\n  filter(year == year_to_analyze) %&gt;%\n  select(milk_produced)\n\n# Create a histogram\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = milk_produced)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 8, boundary=0) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Milk Production (Pounds)\",\n    y = \"Frequency\",\n    title = paste(\"Milk Production Distribution for the Year\", year_to_analyze)\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nExample (Bar Plot)\n\n# Filter data to focus on the top 5 states with the highest milk production\ntop_states &lt;- state_milk_production %&gt;%\n  group_by(state) %&gt;%\n  summarise(avg_Milk = mean(milk_produced)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(avg_Milk)) %&gt;%\n  head(5)\n\n# Create a bar plot to compare milk production in the top 5 states\nbar_plot_top_states &lt;- ggplot(top_states, aes(x = reorder(state, -avg_Milk), y = avg_Milk)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"State\",\n    y = \"Average Milk Production (Pounds)\",\n    title = \"Top 5 States with Highest Milk Production\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Display the bar plot\nprint(bar_plot_top_states)\n\n\n\n\nExample (Scatter Plot with linear fit)\nExpanding upon a dataset that includes data on milk and cheese production in various states and regions, we move beyond the confines of a basic linear plot.

In this example, we will explore faceting in ggplot2 and demonstrate its utility through two different scenarios.\nExample 1:\nIn the first example, we’ll use faceting to create a bar plot that shows the average milk production in the states of New York and California over the years 2010 to 2014.

Aesthetics, as specified with aes() in ggplot2, enable us to distinguish between classes, groups, and data structures effectively.\nIn this section, we will examine key aesthetic properties, such as color, shape, size, labels, and transparency. These attributes function as essential tools for tailoring your visualizations to specific requirements, allowing you to craft informative, customizable plots that faithfully represent your data’s insights.\n\n\n5.4.1 Colour\n1.

This is similar to what we did with colors. For instance, we can use the “species” variable to group our data points by shape.\nIf we’d like to control the size of the data points, we can use the “size” parameter in the same way. And if we want to make data points more or less transparent, we can use the “alpha” parameter.

    "text": "8.2 The GLM framework in R\nAs previously discussed, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) provide a flexible framework for modeling various data types, going beyond traditional linear regression. The three key components of a GLM include the distribution of the response variable, the linear predictor, and the link function connecting the linear predictor to the expected value of the response.\nNow, let’s explore how to define these components in the context of the earlier mentioned distributions, using R.\nBinomial models\n\n# Example: Modeling the probability of success in binary outcomes\nglm_binomial &lt;- glm(response_binary ~ predictor, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))\n\nHere, we use the binomial family to specify the distribution and the logit link function, which connects the linear predictor to the probability of success in binary outcomes.\nPoisson models\n\n# Example: Modeling count data with the Poisson distribution\nglm_poisson &lt;- glm(response_count ~ predictor, family = poisson(link = \"log\"))\n\nIn this case, the poisson family is chosen for count data, and the log link function is applied.\nOrdinal models\n\n# Assuming 'categories' is a factor with ordered levels: \"Low (1)\", \"Medium(2)\", \"High(3)\"\nglm_ordinal &lt;- glm(categories ~ predictor, family = cumulative(link = \"logit\"))\n\nIn this example, the cumulative family is used for ordinal logistic regression within the glm function. The link argument specifies the logit link function, connecting the linear predictor to the cumulative odds of being in or below each category.\nGaussian models\n\n# Example: Modeling continuous variables with Gaussian distribution\nglm_gaussian &lt;- glm(response_continuous ~ predictor, family = gaussian(link = \"identity\"))\n\nContinuous variables can be modeled using the gaussian family, and the choice between the identity or log link function allows for the establishment of a linear relationship between the predictor and the expected value of the response. Opting for the identity function results in a model that closely mirrors the one introduced in chapter 6.\nGeneral framework\nIn each example, the glm function is utilized to fit the model, and the family argument specifies the distribution family, while the link argument defines the link function. These GLM components offer flexibility in adapting the model to diverse data types, providing a powerful tool for statistical modeling in R. It’s noteworthy that beyond the linking functions illustrated in prior examples, there are numerous others available.\nThe following table summarize the association of each distribution with its corresponding linking function and the most commom type of variables used in dairy cows experiment:\n\nCorrespondence between each probability distribution, its associated linking functions, and the most common outcomes measured in dairy cow experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution\nLinking Function\nVariables\n\n\n\nBinomial\nLogit, Probit, cloglog\nAbsence and occurrence of behaviors\n\n\nPoisson\nLog\nNumber of behaviors per time interval, heart rate\n\n\nOrdinal\nLogit\nLameness score\n\n\nGaussian\nIdentity, Log\nMilk production, humidity, temperature, etc.\n\n\n\nThe table offers a quick guide for selecting relevant distributions, linking functions, and understanding variables in dairy cow behavior studies.

This is particularly beneficial when dealing with non-continuous outcomes, allowing for a more versatile modeling approach (McCullagh and Nelder 1989; Dobson 2002).\nProbability Distributions: GLMs are designed to accommodate a range of probability distributions for the response variable, making them suitable for handling non-Gaussian data. For example, the binomial distribution is frequently utilized in GLMs for binary outcomes (McCullagh and Nelder 1989; Dobson 2002).\n\n\n7.1.1 Example: Binomial Model for Animal Behavior\nLet’s consider a scenario where we’re investigating the occurrence of a certain animal behavior, such as standing estrus in cows. This behavior can be represented as a dichotomous variable (0 for absence, 1 for occurrence). We’ll construct a binomial GLM to model this binary outcome based on different ventilation programs.\nWe will explore the logit linking function, among others like probit and cloglog. The logit function is mathematically defined as:\n\\[g(\\mu) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\mu}}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(g(\\mu)\\) is the probability of success (occurrence),\n\\(\\mu\\) is the linear predictor.\n\nThe linear predictor, \\(\\mu\\), is defined as a linear combination of the predictors:\n\\[\\mu = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\ldots + \\beta_kX_k \\]\nThis mirrors the structure of the linear model discussed in the preceding chapter.\nIn the context of the binomial GLM, the probability of success (\\(p\\)) is related to the linear predictor through the logistic function:\n\\[p = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\ldots + \\beta_kX_k)}}\\] Please note that due to the presence of the linking function, it becomes possible to accommodate non-linear relationships between the dependent and independent variables.\nDevelop the example in R\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(stats)\n\n# Create a sample dataset\nset.seed(123)\nanimal_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  Ventilation = rep(c(\"Vent1\", \n                      \"Vent2\", \n                      \"Vent3\", \n                      \"Control\"),\n                    each = 25),\n  Behavior = c(rbinom(n = 25, size = 1, prob = .6),\n               rbinom(n = 25, size = 1, prob = .4),\n               rbinom(n = 25, size = 1, prob = .4),\n               rbinom(n = 25, size = 1, prob = .7))\n)\n\n# Visualize the data\nggplot(animal_data, aes(x = Ventilation, fill = factor(Behavior))) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(title = \"Occurrence of 'standing estrus' by Ventilation Program\",\n       x = \"Ventilation Program\",\n       y = \"Proportion\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n# Fit a binomial GLM with logit link function\nbinomial_model_logit &lt;- glm(Behavior ~ Ventilation, data = animal_data, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))\n\n# Display the summary of the model with logit link function\nsummary(binomial_model_logit)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = Behavior ~ Ventilation, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"), \n    data = animal_data)\n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

The interpretation of odds ratios involves understanding the change in odds for a one-unit increase in the predictor. Here’s how you can create a table and explain the log-odds:\n\n# Create a table for coefficient interpretation\ncoef_table &lt;- exp(coef(binomial_model_logit))\n\n# Display the table\nprint(coef_table)\n\n     (Intercept) VentilationVent1 VentilationVent2 VentilationVent3 \n      4.00000000       0.23076923       0.09722222       0.19642857 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\nVentilationVent1\nVentilationVent2\nVentilationVent3\n\n\n4\n0.2307692\n0.0972222\n0.1964286\n\n\n\n\nThe values in the table represent the odds ratios for each predictor. An odds ratio greater than 1 implies an increase in the odds of success (behavior occurrence), while an odds ratio less than 1 implies a decrease in the odds.\nNow, let’s explain what log-odds means:\nThe log-odds, or logit, is the natural logarithm of the odds. In the context of a logistic regression model, the log-odds can be interpreted as the logarithm of the odds of an event occurring. The transformation from the linear predictor (\\(\\mu\\)) to the log-odds is achieved by the logit function:\n\\[\\text{logit}(\\mu) = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{1 - \\mu}\\right)\\]\nHere, \\(\\mu\\) is the predicted probability of the event (e.g., behavior occurrence). The log-odds represent a linear relationship with the predictors, making it suitable for regression modeling. Exponentiating the coefficients of a logistic regression model yields odds ratios, providing a more interpretable understanding of the impact of predictors on the odds of the event. Let’s interpret each coefficient in the context of the odds ratio:\n\n(Intercept): Represents the odds of the event (e.g., behavior occurrence) in the absence of ventilation. In this scenario, it signifies the odds of occurrence when Ventilation is at the reference level (e.g., Control) or, more precisely, when there is no ventilation.\nVentilationVent1: Captures the effect of Ventilation = “Vent1” relative to the absence of ventilation. An odds ratio of 0.23 suggests that, while holding other variables constant, the odds of the event are 77% lower for Ventilation = “Vent1” compared to the absence of ventilation.\nVentilationVent2: Similarly reflects the effect of Ventilation = “Vent2” relative to the absence of ventilation. An odds ratio of 0.097 implies that the odds of the event are 90.3% lower for Ventilation = “Vent2” compared to the absence of ventilation.\nVentilationVent3: The odds ratio of 0.196 implies an 80.4% reduction in the odds of the event for Ventilation = “Vent3” compared to the absence of ventilation.\n\nThis interpretation clarifies that the intercept represents the starting point or baseline when there is no ventilation.\nWe can also visualize the predicted probabilities for each ventilation program as follows:\n\n# Predicted probabilities\npredicted_probs &lt;- predict(binomial_model_logit, type = \"response\", newdata = animal_data)\n\n# Visualize the predicted probabilities\nanimal_data$Predicted_Prob &lt;- predicted_probs\nggplot(animal_data, aes(x = Ventilation, y = Predicted_Prob)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\", fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Predicted Probabilities of 'Standing struss' by Ventilation Program\",\n       x = \"Ventilation Program\",\n       y = \"Predicted Probability\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nBut, we can also apply Tukey’s HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) test to compare the ventilation programs and then add letters to the predicted probability plot to indicate statistically significant groups. Here’s how you can do that:\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(agricolae)\n\nWarning: package 'agricolae' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\n# Perform Tukey's LSD test\ntukey_results &lt;- LSD.test(aov(binomial_model_logit), \"Ventilation\", group = TRUE)\n\ntukey_results\n\n$statistics\n    MSerror Df Mean       CV  t.value       LSD\n  0.2233333 96  0.5 94.51631 1.984984 0.2653254\n\n$parameters\n        test p.ajusted      name.t ntr alpha\n  Fisher-LSD      none Ventilation   4  0.05\n\n$means\n        Behavior       std  r         se       LCL       UCL Min Max Q25 Q50\nControl     0.80 0.4082483 25 0.09451631 0.6123866 0.9876134   0   1   1   1\nVent1       0.48 0.5099020 25 0.09451631 0.2923866 0.6676134   0   1   0   0\nVent2       0.28 0.4582576 25 0.09451631 0.0923866 0.4676134   0   1   0   0\nVent3       0.44 0.5066228 25 0.09451631 0.2523866 0.6276134   0   1   0   0\n        Q75\nControl   1\nVent1     1\nVent2     1\nVent3     1\n\n$comparison\nNULL\n\n$groups\n        Behavior groups\nControl     0.80      a\nVent1       0.48      b\nVent3       0.44      b\nVent2       0.28      b\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"group\"\n\n\n\n# Extract the letter results into a data frame\ntukey_g &lt;- as.data.frame(tukey_results$groups)\n\n# Extract the mean differences and group names\ntukey_df &lt;- as.data.frame(tukey_results$means)\ntukey_df &lt;- mutate(tukey_df, trt = rownames(tukey_df))\nmerged &lt;- left_join(tukey_df, tukey_g, by = \"Behavior\")\n\n\n# Visualize the predicted probabilities with Tukey's letters\nggplot(merged, aes(x = trt, y = Behavior, fill = trt)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = LCL, ymax = UCL), width = 0.2) + \n  labs(title = \"Predicted Probabilities with Tukey's Letters\",\n       x = \"Ventilation Program\",\n       y = \"Predicted Probability\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  geom_text(data = merged, aes(x = trt, y = UCL + 0.05, label = groups), size = 4, color = \"red\") + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nIt’s crucial to highlight that the initial approach holds substantial advantages over employing post hoc tests. This is because the coefficients, significantly differing from zero, inherently indicate distinctions among all treatments. This fundamental insight simplifies the analysis, rendering post hoc tests less necessary in this context.\nAdditionally, the interpretability of log odds contributes to the straightforward understanding of the results. Unlike complex statistical measures, log odds provide a clear and accessible way to grasp the differences between treatments. This simplicity enhances the practical utility of the analysis, making it more accessible to a broader audience."

The model introduces separate intercepts for each category, assuming the cumulative logits of each category are proportional.\nApplication: Valuable for analyzing data with ordered categorical responses, such as lameness scores in dairy cows.\nPoisson Distribution\nThe Poisson distribution can be derived from the exponential distribution by considering the number of events in fixed intervals of time or space.\nThe probability function of the poison distribution is given by: \\[P(X = k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^k}{k!}\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda\\) is the average rate of events.\nGraphical Representation in R:\n\nlambda &lt;- 3\nx &lt;- seq(0, 10, by = 1)\ny &lt;- dpois(x, lambda)\n\ndf_poisson &lt;- data.frame(x, y)\nggplot(df_poisson, aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"orange\", size = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Poisson Distribution\", x = \"Number of Events\", y = \"Probability\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 7, y = 0.15, label = expression(lambda == 3), \n           color = \"orange\", size = 6) +\n  ggtitle(\"Poisson Distribution\") +\n  labs(x = \"Number of Events\", y = \"Probability\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Application: Suitable for count data, especially in scenarios involving rare events.\nGaussian Distribution\nThe Gaussian distribution can be obtained as a limiting case of the binomial distribution when the number of trials becomes large. The Central Limit Theorem plays a crucial role in this transition.\nThe probability function density function of the binomial distribution is given by:\n\\[f(x | \\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\cdot e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the mean and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation.\nGraphical Representation in R:\n\nmu &lt;- 0\nsigma &lt;- 1\nx &lt;- seq(-5, 5, by = 0.1)\ny &lt;- dnorm(x, mean = mu, sd = sigma)\n\ndf_gaussian &lt;- data.frame(x, y)\nggplot(df_gaussian, aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"red\", linewidth = 2) +\n  labs(title = \"Gaussian Distribution\", x = \"x\", y = \"Probability Density\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -3, y = 0.35, label = expression(mu == 0 ~ and ~ sigma == 1), \n           color = \"red\", size = 6) +\n  ggtitle(\"Gaussian Distribution\") +\n  labs(x = \"x\", y = \"Probability Density\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Application: Modeling continuous variables, offering a versatile framework for various measurements in diverse fields."

If the p-value from the test is greater than a significance level (commonly 0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the residuals follow a normal distribution.\nHere’s how you can perform the normality test in R:\n\n# Extract residuals of the linear model\nresiduals &lt;- residuals(lm_model)\n\n# Shapiro-Wilk test for normality\nshapiro_test &lt;- shapiro.test(residuals)\n\n# Visualization of residuals\nqqnorm(residuals)\nqqline(residuals)\n\n\n\n# Display the normality test results\nprint(shapiro_test)\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  residuals\nW = 0.99244, p-value = 0.852\n\n\nCorrection:\nBreakdown of the code:\n\nFirst, we extract the residuals using the residuals function.\nThe Shapiro-Wilk test (one of the common normality tests) is performed using shapiro.test on the residuals.\nA Q-Q plot is generated using qqnorm and qqline to visually assess the normality of the residuals.\nThe results of the normality test are printed using print(shapiro_test).\n\nInterpretation: Inspect the p-value from the Shapiro-Wilk test. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, it suggests that we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of normality. Additionally, examine the Q-Q plot; if the residuals closely follow the reference line, it indicates normality."
